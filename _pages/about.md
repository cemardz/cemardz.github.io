p.s. I hope others don't suffer like me

We all have value. Just as stars come in different shapes and sizes, we are all unique and special in our own way. Each star is beautiful in its own right, and just as we come together to form galaxies, we as people with different values and abilities come together to create a society.

Stars help lost travelers navigate their way, and we also help each other. In any situation, we strive to work together and grow to move in a better direction.

The reason why Earth is bright and beautiful is because of the sun shining upon it. Likewise, we can create a better world by shining upon each other. We give and receive inspiration and knowledge, and working together will bring good results for us all.

We are all shining like stars, but sometimes we may not recognize our own value. However, what we need to know is that we are already shining. Our pain, wandering, and depression can become meaningful milestones for someone else. We have meaning just by shining in our own place. We are all stars.

Someone may pray to become a beautiful star like me who never gives up, but in fact, we need to know that we are already beautiful stars. Our mission is to make the world more wonderful with our unique beauty. Therefore, we must recognize and respect each other and grow together.

Lastly, I hope for a world where everyone understands and respects each other. Recognizing our differences, acknowledging and respecting them is necessary for us all to live together. May we all work towards a better world and a happier life.
