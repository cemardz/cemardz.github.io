### Introduction
I'm going to post briefly today about what a semiconductor is. I'm not a graduate of a semiconductor department, nor am I a graduate of electronics or electrical engineering. Therefore, there may be errors in my post.

Semiconductors are a technology that cannot be overlooked in our daily lives. This is because we are using everything from smartphones to computers, cars, and various home appliances in our daily lives. In modern society, it is unthinkable without semiconductors.

### What is a semiconductor?
As you can tell from its name, a semiconductor refers to a material that 'semi' 'conducts' electricity. This refers to a material whose electrical conductivity is positioned between that of metals and insulators. Due to these properties, semiconductors are used to control the flow of electricity, which plays an important role in various electronic devices.

The most representative example of a semiconductor is silicon. Silicon chips are widely used in Apple. Silicon is one of the major elements constituting the Earth's surface and can be easily obtained industrially. The semiconductor properties of silicon are not outstanding in their pure state, but they can be greatly improved in electrical conductivity through a process called 'impurity doping'.

### Principle of Semiconductors
To understand how semiconductors work, you first need to know about the 'electrical conductivity of materials'. The electrical conductivity of a material depends on how well the valence electrons of its atoms can move. Metals, where electrons can move freely, conduct electricity well, but insulators hardly allow electron movement.
Semiconductors are located between these two. Pure semiconductors are close to insulators, but their electrical conductivity can be improved by adding impurities. This is known as 'impurity doping'. Through doping, semiconductors can act as switches to control the flow of electricity.

### Types of Semiconductors
Semiconductors are divided into N-type and P-type depending on the type of doped impurity. N-type semiconductors refer to semiconductors in which impurities with many electrons are doped, increasing the number of electrons. On the other hand, P-type semiconductors refer to semiconductors in which impurities that can accept electrons are doped, increasing the state of 'holes', which lack electrons. By appropriately combining these two types of semiconductors, various electronic devices can be created.

### Application of Semiconductors
Since semiconductors are used to control the flow of electricity due to their characteristics, they are utilized in various electronic devices. The most representative example is the transistor. Transistors are electronic components made by appropriately combining N-type and P-type semiconductors and act as switches to control the flow of electricity. In addition, semiconductors are used in various electronic components such as diodes, LEDs, solar cells, monitors, etc.

Furthermore, semiconductors are used in computer CPUs and memory, and the advancement of such semiconductor technology is leading the modern information society.

### Conclusion
Semiconductors are an essential technology in modern society. It is also a technology in which I have taken a lot of interest. The development of semiconductor technology will continue to make our lives more convenient and affluent. Through this post, we looked at the basic concepts, principles, and applications of semiconductors. Thank you.
