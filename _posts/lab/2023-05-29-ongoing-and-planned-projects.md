<h3 class="header">Agriculture</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Smart Farm Digital Twin Research:</strong> The digital twin technology enables replicating physical environment into virtual and optimising for agriculture, predicting and analysing crop growth, and solving potential problems.</li>
<li><strong>Agricultural Product Data Research:</strong> Insights can be gained in various aspects such as production, quality, and price prediction of agricultural products through data analysis. Developing prediction models for climate change and pest prevention is also an important research direction.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="header">Robotics</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Building Robots based on ROS:</strong> ROS (Robot Operating System) is a flexible and scalable framework for robot development. Research can be conducted on the design, construction, and operation of robots based on this.</li>
<li><strong>Manufacture of ROSMaster X3:</strong> ROSMaster is an important element of ROS, managing nodes and communication in the ROS network. The manufacture of ROSMaster X3 can be understood as creating a new ROSMaster that provides enhanced functions and performance.</li>
<li><strong>Development of Drone Autonomous Driving for Smart Farming:</strong> In the field of agriculture, drones can be used for various purposes such as crop monitoring and pesticide spraying. To effectively carry out these tasks, it is necessary to develop the autonomous driving function of drones.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="header">Semiconductors</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Creation of RTOS (Real Time Operating System):</strong> RTOS is an operating system used in application areas requiring real-time processing. Research for creating this can focus on designing and implementing a system that complies with timing constraints.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="header">Environment, Energy</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Research on Upcycling, Agriculture, and Renewable Energy:</strong> Upcycling is the process of recreating waste into more valuable items. Research on this can proceed in the direction of developing new products from agricultural waste or constructing sustainable agricultural systems through integration with renewable energy.</li>
<li><strong>Research on Policies such as Environmental Taxes and Carbon Emissions Trading:</strong> By conducting research on various policies for environmental protection, especially taxes and carbon emissions trading, more effective environmental policies can be proposed and implemented. Research can include analyzing the effects of current policies, exploring improvement measures, and proposing new policies.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="header">Bio</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ways to Utilize Genome and Microbiome Data:</strong> Genomic research is a core field of life science, and microbiome research plays a critical role in understanding the impact on our health and disease. Using this data, research can be conducted in the direction of developing new treatments, preventing and managing diseases, and personalized medicine.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="header">ETC</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Building MLOps Environment:</strong> MLOps is an approach that integrates the development and operation of machine learning. Research on building an MLOps environment can focus on finding ways to manage the development, testing, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of machine learning models more effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Applying Blockchain Technology to Actual Industries:</strong> Blockchain technology can be applied to various industries such as supply chain management, finance, and healthcare. This research can explore the application methods of blockchain technology by industry, potential benefits, challenges, and focus on developing ways to effectively apply blockchain technology to actual industries.</li>
