Today, I woke up in the morning and cheerfully headed to the I went to Daiso. I believe there are similar stores like the Dollar Store in the United States or Canada. You can think of Daiso as the most comparable to the Dollar Store.

The reason for going to the Daiso was that I wanted to plant green onions, and so I was on my way to purchase pots, soil, and various other necessary items. However, as soon as I stepped outside, I had this nagging feeling that something was wrong. The weather was unbearably hot and the scorching sunlight greeted me.

Leaving the hot sun behind, I quickly bought what I needed from the Daiso and on my way home, I was waiting for the signal to change. I felt a breeze and heard the faint rustling of trees. The wind was not necessarily cool, but the sensation of the warm breeze was somehow comforting. The quiet morning street with no one around, the sensation that only I could feel - it's difficult to convey this in words, and you may not empathize unless you've experienced it yourself.

I wonder who would understand this feeling? I wish many could feel and empathize with it. Anyhow, in this pleasant mood, I arrived home, set up the pots, and planted the green onions.
