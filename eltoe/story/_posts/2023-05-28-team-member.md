Hello, I am CMZ, the team leader of ELTOE. We are recruiting members for our smart farm startup team who are willing to work with us to lead a innovative and sustainable future.

Our ELTOE team pursues innovation in the smart farm field and strives to create a better future through cutting-edge technology. However, it is challenging to achieve this goal alone. Collaboration with experts in various fields is necessary to achieve such great goals.

We aim to provide an environment where team members can think independently, propose creative ideas, and motivate each other to work. Therefore, we hope that our future team members will be passionate and challenge-loving individuals. Here are the areas of expertise we are looking for:

**Cybersecurity Expert:** Safeguard various data generated in smart farms and implement strategies to defend the system from external attacks. Your knowledge and expertise play an essential role in protecting our future agricultural data.

**Smart Farm Construction Engineer:** Design the physical structure of smart farms, build facilities, and create an environment for optimal crop production. Your expertise plays a crucial role in forming the core infrastructure of the smart farm.

**Data Scientist:** Analyze large amounts of data collected from smart farms and suggest ways to increase crop yields and maximize efficiency based on the results.

**AI Engineer:** Develop an AI-based crop management system and develop algorithms to optimize crop yields by analyzing agricultural data.

**Semiconductor Expert:** Provide high-performance semiconductor solutions for various sensors and devices in smart farms, and design and develop optimized hardware.

**Agriculture Expert:** Research how traditional farming methodologies and smart farm technologies can be combined, understand the growth process of crops, and suggest optimal production conditions.

**Robotics Expert:** Develop and optimize robots to automate crop management and harvesting processes within smart farms.

**Energy Expert:** Maximize the energy efficiency of smart farms, suggest sustainable energy use, and develop necessary energy solutions.

**IoT Engineer:** Connect various devices within the smart farm and ensure smooth data communication. This enables real-time monitoring and efficient resource management of the smart farm.

**ICT Engineer:** Design, build, and operate the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure of smart farms. This ensures smooth data collection, storage, analysis, sharing processes.

**System/Software Engineer:** Understand the overall system flow of the smart farm, develop necessary software, and ensure stable system operation.

**Marketing Expert:** Develop the business model of the smart farm, analyze market trends, and establish strategies to effectively sell the smart farm's products or services.

**Logistics Expert:** Manage and optimize the entire supply chain from crop production in the smart farm to delivery to customers. This enables quick and efficient delivery while maintaining freshness.

**Public Policy/Regulation Expert:** Understand the laws, policies, and regulations related to agriculture, apply them to the operation of smart farms, and manage cooperation with related institutions.

**Legal Advisor:** Solve various legal issues related to smart farms and provide advice to prevent legal problems.

**Quality Control Expert:** Manage the quality of crops produced in smart farms and arrange methods for improving product quality.

**Designer:** In charge of the brand image and product design of the smart farm, convey the value of the smart farm through visual elements. Also, design the user interface and experience (UI/UX) to enhance user convenience.

**Biologist/Ecologist:** Understand the biological characteristics of crops and ecosystems, and optimize the way of growing crops in smart farms based on this. Also, research methods to make smart farms sustainable and minimize their impact on the environment.

Each role is essential, and we strive for the success of the smart farm by sharing and collaborating on each other's expertise and experiences. Our ELTOE team looks forward to a group of experts from various fields coming together to solve problems and create effective solutions.
